# Battery Carbon Emission Calculator

This project aims to empower users to effortlessly calculate the carbon emissions generated by their device batteries. Without requiring technical knowledge, users can input their battery details and receive an accurate estimate of their carbon footprint.

## Features

- **Simple User Interface:** Effortless input of battery details for a smooth user experience.
- **Cross-Device Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on both iPhones and Samsung devices.
- **Data Cleanup and Manipulation:** Efficient data handling using pandas.
- **Accurate Estimations:** Utilizes GPT-40 mini for laptop battery capacities due to the lack of large public datasets.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Built using Rust and the Axum framework.
- **Device Detection:**
  - iPhone: Matches options through screen resolutions.
  - Samsung: Solves unique user agent strings.
- **Data Processing:** Utilizes pandas for data cleanup and manipulation.
- **AI Integration:** GPT-40 mini is employed for estimating laptop battery capacities.
